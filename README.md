This is a project based on Content Based Recommendation System using Streamlit. It simplifies movie selection by recommending similar movies when a specific film is searched, providing a more personalized and enjoyable movie-watching experience. It recommends a list of the top 10 movies that are similar to the one being searched for. Hope you enjoy it:)

### Instructions how to go about it:
1. **Run this code for installation of necessary libraries :** ```!pip install streamlit pickle```(if required) <br><br>
2. **Run the contents of jupyter file 'Content Based Recommendation System.ipynb' to get pickle files i.e `movie_list.pkl` and `similarity.pkl`**<br><br>
3. **Open Anaconda Prompt, enter the current directory of the folder using 'cd' command :** ```cd folder_path```.
   <br>**For Example:** ```cd C:\Users\Desktop\Github\Content-Based-Movie-RS```<br><br> 
4. **Run this code after step 3 , to launch your streamlit app :** ```streamlit run app.py``` (make sure you have entered the current directory where app.py is present using 'cd' command)
